* Layer 3 Environments
	* Robust network design includes efficient transfer of packets or frames
	* Also considers how to recover quickly from faults in the network
	* Layer 3 routing protocols keep track of redundant paths, allowing many paths to remain up and active
	* Advantages:
		* Fault-tolerance, load-sharing
			* if something breaks, the system will auto correct and get around that break
* Layer 2 Environments
	* No routing protocols used
	* Active, redundant paths not allowed or desired
	* Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) provides network link redundancy so a Layer 2 switched network can recover from failures without intervention in a timely manner
	* STP is defined in the IEEE 802.1D standard
		* Everything else in Layer 2 
	* Only 1 active path allowed at a time
* Transparent Bridge / Ethernet Switch
	* Builds table correlating source MAC address with port numbers
	* Floods broadcasts out all available ports
	* Unknown unicast = broadcast
	* Frames not modified by bridge{{./pasted_image001.png}}

* Loops
	* Corrupts SAT
	* Inifinite loop of frames between switches
	* Story 1
		* 2 Switches, flushed SAT's, infinite loop and corrupted SATs
	* Story 2
	* Story 3
* Preventing Loops with STP
	* STP enables switches to be aware of each other and to negotiate a loop-free path
	* Loops are discovered before they're made available
	* Redundant links shut down, but can be brought up easily in case of link failure
	* Algorithm chooses reference point, calculates redundant paths to that point, picks one, blocks the other
* Bridge Protocol Data Units
	* Switch sends BPDU out port using unique MAC address of port itself as source address
	* Destination address is the STP multicast address 01-80-c2-00-00-00
	* Configuration BPDU - Spanning Tree Computation
	* Topology Change Notification (TCN) BPDU - Announces network topology changes

	* Bridge ID
		* 8-byte value
		* Bridge Priority (2 bytes) - priority or weight of switch in relation to all other switches
			* 0 through 65,535, configurable in increments of 4096
			* **32768** (**0x8000**) default Catalyst switch value
				* ABCD
					* A - 4096
					* B - 256
					* C - 16
					* D - 1
		* MAC Address (6 bytes)
	* Port ID
		* 2-byte value
			* Port Priority (1 byte) - priority or weight of switch in relation to all other ports
				* 0 through 240, configurable in increments of 16
				* 128 (0x80) default Catalyst switch value
			* Port Number (1 byte)
				* Represented by different numbers on different devices
	* Electing a root bridge
		* BPDUs sent with Root Bridge ID equal to each switch's Bridge ID
		* Sender Bridge ID equal to each switch's Bridge ID as well
		* After root decided, configuration BPDUs only sent by Root Bridge
		* All other switches must forward or relay BPDUs
		* BPDUs analyzed to see if "better" Root Bridge exists
		* When switch hears of better Root Bridge, it replaces the Root Bridge ID, and adertises it

* Sender Bridge ID
* Root Bridge ID
* Electing Root
	* Lower is better
* Electing Root Ports
	* Each non-root switch must figure out where it is in relation to the Root Bridge
	* Performed by selecting only one Root Port on each non-root switch
	* Root Path Cost
	* Path Cost

* Electing Designated Ports
	* One of the links on a segment should forward traffic to and from that segment (DP)
	* Based on the lowest cumulative Root Path cost to the Root Bridge

{{./pasted_image007.png}}
Every segment needs a designated port

* SAT
	* 300 seconds before it's wiped
