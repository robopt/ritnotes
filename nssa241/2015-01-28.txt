	* Data
	* Processing
		
			 Data
[ L5 Data ][ L6 Data ][ L7 Data ] 

		TCP Segment (Layer 5)
[ TCP Header ][ Data ]
[ TCP Header ][ Data ]
[ TCP Header ][ Data ]
[ TCP Header ][ Data ]

	UDP Datagram (Layer 4)
[ UDP Header][ Data ][ Data ][ Data] 

	Packet (Layer 3)
[ IP ][ TCP Header ][ Data ]
[ IP ][ UDP Header ][ Data ][ Data ][ Data ]

	Frame (Layer 2)
[ Ethernet ][ IP ][ TCP Header][ Data ][ FCS/CRC ]
[ Ethernet ][ IP ][ UDP Header][ Data ][ Data ][ Data ][ FCS/CRC ]

* OSI Model (Open System Interconnect)
	* Layer 7 - Application
		* API (Application Programming Interface)
			* No networking going on put the process has started
		* Examples
			* DNS (Domain Name System)
				* Map Name to an IP
			* DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
				* TL;DR: Giving out IP's
			* HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
				* Web Protocol
		* PDU (Protocol Data Unit)
			* Data
		* Mainly Software Developers
	* Layer 6 - Presentation
		* Compression/Decompression
		* Encryption/Decryption
		* Formatting Specification / Adhering to the specification
		* Data isn't changing but it's representation/how it looks does.
		* Mainly Software Developers
	* Layer 5 - Session
		* Establish, Maintain, and Terminate Connections
		* Simplex
			* One way communication
		* Half-Duplex
			* 2 way communication
			* 1 at a time
			* All wireless is half-duplex (cant send/recieve on same freq)
		* Full-Duplex
			* Send an recieve at same time
			* Wired Networking if the NIC supports it
		* Between Applications
		* Mainly Software Developers
	* Layer 4 - Transport
		* Between Machines
		* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
			* Connection oriented communication
			* Guaranteed Delivery
			* Acknowledged
			* Checksum'd
		* UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
			* Does not establish a connection
			* Not Guaranteed Delivery
			* Not Acknowledged
			* Not checksum'd
			* Real-time communication
				* Audio/Video streaming (not youtube though)
	* 3 Network
		* TCP/IP
		* IP Header is added to datagram/segments encapsulated into a packet
		* Logical Addresses on the network
			* Source IP
			* Destination IP
	* 2 Data Link
		* Input - Output / NIC
		* Ethernet Header and Footer added
			* Header: Ethernet
				* MAC Addresses (Media Access Control)
					* Source MAC
					* Destination MAC
			* Footer: FCS (Frame Check Sequence) 
				* Checksum - CRC (cyclic redundancy check)
	* 1 Physical
		* Placed as bits and bytes and turned into a frame
		* The physical layer defines the means of transmitting raw bits rather than logical data packets over a physical link connecting network nodes. (wiki)

* ISO
	* International Organization for Standardization (IOS)
* Protocol
	* are rules and guidelines

* Programs/Software
	* Way into a machine / out of a machine is through a program
	* Daemon/Service (subset of Programs)
		* Runs independant of a log-on
		* Usually started before login
		* Usually closed after login
* PDU
	* Protocol data unit
