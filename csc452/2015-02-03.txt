* Pointers
	* References to things
	* NULL Pointer
		* Guaranteed to be invalid
		* "This pointer points to nothing"
		* Representation varies
		* Typically in <stdio.h>
		* (void*)0
	* Void Pointer
		* Generic pointer
		* "Pointer to byte"
	* Pointer Arithmetic
		* Pointer Â± integer
		* Pointer - pointer
		* Scaled arithmetic
			* Increment is multiplied by the size of what the pointer points to
			* Incrementing a pointer to a "thing" makes it point to the next "thing" in memory
		* Can compare pointers to same base type
			* Can use all relationals: < <= == != >= >
	* Function Pointers
		* Concept: declare pointer to an entity having
			* A specific set of arguments
			* A specific return values
		* Syntax of function declaration:
			* type name ( arglist );
			* Declaresname as a function taking arglist as a parameter
* CPP Directives
	* #<directive> <option>
	* File Inclusion
		* CPP "Splices in" the file's contents at this point
		* Two forms:
			* #include "path"
				* Search current working directory
			* #include <path>
				* Search path
