* What does a Sys Admin do?
	* Understand both the technology and the business mission
	* Problem Solving
	* Work with people
	* Be a facilitator
	* Train users
* Qualities of a Successful Sys Admin
	* INTEGRITY
		* Sage code of ethics
	* Ability to listen
	* Ability to business processes from users and technical perspectives
	* Resourcefulness
		* Adapt, improvise, overcome
* Sys Admin basic strategies
	* Plan it before you do it
	* Make it reversible
	* Make changes incrementally
	* Test, test, test before you unleash it.
	* Know how things really work
* Keeping Balance
	* A Sysadmin contains equal parts
		* Technical / computer skills
		* People and communication skills
		* Problem-solving / common sense
	* Goal: Be Prepared.
		* Anticipate the inevitable and prepare for eventualities
* Prevention is better
* Virtualization Models
	* Type 1
		* Xenserver, VMWare ESXi, MS Hyper-V
		* Bare-Metal Virtualization
		* VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor)
	* Type 2
		* VMWare Workstation, Virtual Box
		* Virtualization sitting on top of host OS
* Virtualization Techniques
	* Goal: intercept any VM machine instruction that could effect system state.
	* Binary Translation
		* the VMM intercepts any system calls that could effect system state and translate them so that they do not impact other VMs.
	* Hardware Assist
		* Special processors (Intel-vt and AMD-v) intercept any system calls that would effect the system state and redirect them to the VMM.
	* Paravirtualization
		* VM Operating systems are modified so that they are aware that they are running in a virtualized environment. 
		* Any hypercalls are redirected to the VMM.
* Virtualization Benefits
	* Consolidate systems, workloads, and operating environments:
		* Multiple workloads and operating systems can be combined onto one physical server, reducing the costs of hardware and operations
			* Workload: What the server does.
		* New versions of software can be tested on the hardware that they will later use in production mode without affecting production workloads
		* Virtual systems can be used as low-cost test systems without jeopardizing production workloads
		* Multiple operating system types and releases can run on a single system. Each virtual system can run the operating system that best matches it's appliucation or user requirements.
