* User Accounts: Linux vs. AD
	* Active Directory
		* Windows originally a single user system
		* Domain accounts part of distributed multi-master database
		* Give access to many resources also controlled by the AD
		* By default are replicated to all DCs that are part of a AD
	* Linux
		* Originally a multi-user system
		* Each machine has it's own passwd file that lists user accounts
		* Each machine has its own groups file that lists all the groups
		* To syncronize accounts machines, you have to synchronize passwd and groups files
* Win2K# User Account Administration
	* What are they used for?
	* Context:
		* Local Accounts
		* AD Accounts
	* What do non-IT users value?
		* Stability of platform
		* Reliable and consistent access to resources
* Types of Accounts
	* Authentication vs Authorization
		* Authentication
			* Proving who you assert to be
		* Authorization
			* What resources do you get?
			* Privileges
	* Local user accounts
		* Uses SAM access
			* SAM?
		* Does not exist in AD
			* No network resources, no authentication
	* Built-in user accounts
		* Administrator - Access? Permissions? Concerns?
		* Guest - Access? Permissions?	Concerns?
		* Process control
	* Domain user accounts
		* Domain user
		* Domain administrator
* Account Authentication
	* Local accounts
	* Domain accounts
		* Authenticated by a domain controller
		* Authenticated users receive a SID
			* SID functions like a ring of keys that fits into locks associated with network resources
		* User profile
			* What is stored, how stored, what is transferred?
* User Profiles
	* What is a profile?
		* Group of user settings that define the look and feel of a user's environment

		* User changes stored locally
* Types of User Profiles cont.
	* Roaming profile
		* Stored on network drive
		* Allows user to have same desktop on any machine they log in to on your network
		* Choices - Roam, home path
		* Active Directory handles this
	* Mandatory profiles
		* Changes to desktop and ohter settings are not saved
		* Gives a much higher level of control over the desktop
		* Avoids many issues where multiple users use one computer
* How does computer system security provide protection?
	* System Access Controls
		* Ensure unauthorized users don't access the system
		* Require legitimate users to follow good security practices
		* Protect password data
		* Keep track of what users are doing on the system
	* Data Access Controls
		* Monitor who can access what data and for what purpose
	* System and Security Administration
	* Offline procedures and policies
		* Clearly define the responsibilities of the system administrator and user
		* Train and monitor users
		* Risk management and analysis
	* System Design
		* Looks at system architecture for things like segmentation of memory to prevent one application accessing the memory resources allocated to another
* User Accounts
	* Common Themes:
		* What are you logging into?
			* Domain
			* Individual system
		* Every user must have a username and password to logon
			* Other kinds of users
		* Group membership as a means to manage system rights and permissions
			* Standard groups of users
			* Guest, Administrator, root
* Enterprise Authentication
	* How does this translate into an enterprise environment?
		* Identity Management
		* IAM
		* Federated Identities
		* Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
