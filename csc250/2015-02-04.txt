* Style Guide Continued
	* Lots of lines of code.. 
		* Comments are important
		* Not what each line of code is "doing", but the block is doing
			* Assume he can do the assembly
* ALU Instructions
	* Arithmatic Logic Unit
	* All binary operators will take 3 operands
	* All operands will be registers
		* r1 = r2 op r3
			* add rd, rs1, rs2
				* rd = destination
				* rs# = sources
			* sub rd, rs1, rs2
				* rd = destination
				* rs# = sources
			* and rd, rs1, rs2
				* rd = destination
				* rs# = sources
			* or rd, rs1, rs2
				* rd = destination
				* rs# = sources
			* nand rd, rs1, rs2
				* rd = destination
				* rs# = sources
			* nand rd, rs1
				* rd = destination
				* rs1  = source
* Immediate
	* imm being a #
	* addi rt, rs1, imm
	* ori rt, rs1, imm
	* xori rt, rs1, imm
	* nandi rt, rs1, imm
