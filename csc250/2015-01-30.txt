CISC										RISC
VAX		x86					PowerPC 	ARM	MIPS

* CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
	* Some of the instructions in the instruction set are complex (alot of work)
	* Exec Time
		* Low Instruction Count
		* High Cycles per instruction
		* Clock Cycle equal
	* Example:
		* VAX
* RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)
	* Reduced Complexity - Simple
	* All instructions are simple
	* Do a little work.
	* Exec Time
		* High Instruction Count
		* Low Cycle per instruction
		* Clock Cycle equal
	* Example:
		* MIPS
* Execution Time Formula
	* Number of Instruction Executed
	* times
	* Time to compute 1 instruction
		* Cycles per Instruction (weighted average)
		* Clock Cycle Time
