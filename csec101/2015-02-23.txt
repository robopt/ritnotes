* TCP/UDP
	* over layer 4 - transport layer
	* Ports are part of a socket
* Scanning
	* Broad topic
		* Wireless scans and war-driving
		* OS finger printing
		* Layer scans such as ARP
		* IPv6 scans
	* Most people think port scans
	* Most people think nmap = port scans
* Recall clients and servers
	* Ideas
		* sockets (ports and IP addresses)
		* Client and server software
		* Client and server machines
	* MAC Addresses are not int it
* What is a port scan
	* Examination of the status of the layer 4 ports
	* Can b used as a basis for other types of more in-depth scans
	* Both TCP and UDP scans can be done
		* NOT THE SAME
	* Since TCP and UDP behave differently, the scan must be accomplished using different techniques
	* We'll cover both
* SMP
	* simple management protocol
* Start with TCP scans
	* Remember the handshakes
	* The connection handshake is what we are after
	* Turns out that you can also use this to tie up a server
		* DoS (Denial of Service)
		* SYN flood
			* Repeatedly sending SYN requests, server allocates resources / thread
* Attack topology
	* The attacker aims nmap at a target
		* May or may not be on the same network
	* For TCP, a collection of packets with the SYN flag set are directed at the target
		* SYN ACK for ports which are open
		* RST ACK for ports which are closed
	* For UDP, A straight forward connection attempt with no handshake
		* This time we will simply send UDP packets the varying destination ports
		* ICMP destination unreachable


Nmap: Scanning the Internet
* Scan Challenges
	* P2P scanning?
	* Legal Issues
	* ISP response
		* nmap dev? lolk
	* US DoD response
		* DoD JTF-GNO: Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations
		* stop it
	* Firewalls
		* Network conditions often differ signficantly behind firewalls vs Internet scanning
		* Contributed data
	* Performance and Accuracy
		* Internet scanning is long, hard work. Can be hisheartening:
		* Finding and resolving performance issues
* Optimizing Host Discovery
	* Goals
	* Big challenge: Deciding on discovery methods
	* Echo requests and even Nmap default discovery (TCP ACK to port 80 & echo request) are often insufficient for Internet scanning
	* TCP Host discovery methods
		* SYN packet discovery (-PS)
			* Best against stateful firewalls
		* ACK packet discovery (-PA)
			* Best against stateless firewalls
		* Top Ports
			* Adding more TCP SYN and ACK probes can help, burt which ports work the best?
				* 80 / http
				* 25 / smtp
				* 22 / ssh
				* 443 / https
				* 21 / ftp
				* 113 / auth
				* 23 / telnet
				* 53 / domain
				* 554 / rtsp
				* 3389 / ms-term-server
			* Some with syn probes, some with syn acks
	* UDP Host Discovery (-PU)
	* ICMP Host Discovery (-PE, -PM, -PP)
		* Some systems intentially allow echo requests, but block the others
		* Others block echo requests explicitly 
	* Protocol Ping (-PO)
		* Default is to send 3 probs, for protocols 1 (ICMP), 2 (IGMP) and 4 (IPnP)
	* Enhanced Discovery Results
* Upgrade your Nmap
	* svn 
* Default Scan Ports
	* 1715 ports for TCP scans
	* 1488 for UDP scans
	* 1-1024 + all named ports
* Augmented nmap-services
	* -F fast scan
* Fast Sccan Example
	* nmap -sUP -F -T4 scanme.nmap.org
	* 4.68: 1h 2min
	* With bhdc08: 6min 29sec
	* With bhdc08 & "--version-intensity 0": 13 sec
	* All three found the same open port: 53
* -top-ports n
* -port-ratio n
* Top TCP
	* 80
	* 23
	* 22
	* 443
	* 3389
	* 445
	* 139
* Top UDP
	* halp
* Packet Rate control
	* min-rate
	* max-rate
* nmap -S <src> -d --max-scan-delay 10 -oA logs/tcp-allports-%t-%d -iL tcp-allports-1M-IPs --max-retries 1 --randomize-hosts -p--PS21,22,23,25,53,80,443 -T4 --min-hostgroup 256 minrate 175 -max-rate 300
